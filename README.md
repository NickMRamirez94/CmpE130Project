Project Description
===================

This purpose of this project is to work in a group of two to solve a simple natural language problem using methods, algorithms, and techniques learned in CMPE 130.

This project contains a website interface used to mimic a site that could possibly be used by a delivery driver to plot a delivery route for the day.
